### Speech masking experiments

This is how i tried to implement speech masking by changing real voice of a speaker.

### Speech files

 - files/orig – original speech
 - files/masked – speech with masked algorithm applied
 - files/restored – a try to restore masked speech using naive inverted algorithm

### Guarantees

I provide no guarantees that masked speech cannot be restored. Be careful!
